picolua is comprised of components from many different people and
organizations. The specific licence model should be indicated in each source
file. All the licences have in common that the code may be freely reproduced,
distributed, and modified and, of course, that there is no warranty of any
kind. 

This program is a proof-of-concept, and the maintainer does not make any
representations that it is fit for any purpose.
