There are things that the web interface can do, that are not exposed in the
REST API. For completeness, and to make it easier to implement new clients,
these API calls need to be added.

Database scan progress needs to be written to disk, and details shown in the
Web UI.

Implement API for full scan (current /api/scan) only does a "quick" scan.

Implement seek within file/stream. It would nice to do this in the web UI using
a slider (like the volume slide).

Split path components in files/directories display, to make navigation easier.

Put an "up" link in the files/directories display
 
Search in files/folders -- this should be done using the media database:
searching the whole media root in a Web UI action would be inappropriate.

Read RC file at server start (rather than needing to specify a long command
line).
 
The Web interface doesn't show the file part of the media URL in the interface
at all, if it contains an "#" character. This is an oddity of the rather ugly
parse_uri() function. This won't be easy to fix.

Put message line somewhere it will always be seen (and not scrolled out of the way).
