## API

There are things that the web interface can do, that are not exposed
in the REST API. For completeness, and to make it easier to implement
new clients, these API calls need to be added.

Implement API for full scan (current /api/scan) only does a "quick"
scan.

Implement seek within file/stream. It would nice to do this in the
web UI using a slider (like the volume slide).

## Web interface

The biggest problem with the Web interface is that it is not
at all ergonomic was large search results (e.g., large album
collections). Results are displayed page-by-page, and there's
really not way to know which page is the right one. It would
be better if the search results page automatically expanded
when scrolled to the bottom (like it does in the Qobuz web
interface). But this would require a radical revision of the
web interface, and probably API changes as well.  

Split path components in files/directories display, to make
navigation easier.

Put an "up" link in the files/directories display
 
Search in files/folders -- this should be done using the media
database: searching the whole media root in a Web UI action would be
inappropriate.

Put message line somewhere it will always be seen (and not scrolled
out of the way).

The Web interface doesn't show the file part of the media URL in the
interface at all, if it contains an "#" character. This is an oddity
of the rather ugly parse_uri() function. This won't be easy to fix.

In the playlist, replace the filename with track info from the media
database, where possible.

## General

Read an RC file at server start (rather than needing to specify a
long command line).

Document regex limitations

There are probably many outstanding problems related to quoting and
escaping strings. Quotation marks are particularly troublesome, 
because they have to be escaped different for URL, for JavaScript
calls, and for SQL.
