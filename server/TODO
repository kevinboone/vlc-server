There are things that the web interface can do, that are not exposed in the
REST API. For completeness, and to make it easier to implement new clients,
these API calls need to be added.

Database scan progress needs to be written to disk, and details shown in the
Web UI.

We don't really have a good way to build the database from scratch using the
`vlc-server` server process, either through the web UI or the REST API. The
server only opens the database when it starts, for reasons of speed. If there
isn't a database, the server won't ever open it, even if it is later created by
a scan. Currently the documentation recommends creating a database manually in
the first instance. This is not ideal.

Implement API for full scan (current /api/scan) only does a "quick" scan.

Implement seek within file/stream. It would nice to do this in the web UI using
a slider (like the volume slide).

Split path components in files/directories display, to make navigation easier.

Put an "up" link in the files/directories display
 
Implement radio stream list (how do we maintain this?)

Search in files/folders -- this should be done using the media database:
searching the whole media root in a Web UI action would be inappropriate.

Read RC file at server start (rather than needing to specify a long command
line).
 
The Web interface doesn't show the file part of the media URL in the interface
at all, if it contains an "#" character. This is an oddity of the rather ugly
parse_uri() function. This won't be easy to fix.
