Defective audio files can break the media scanner. I've noticed this when I've
copied files onto a memory stick, and a file has been truncated because the
stick wasn't large enough. The scanner would get to the truncated file, and
never get any further. The scanner needs to be more robust, because this kind
of problem is probably not unusual.

Short audio dropouts, that appears as 'clicks' in the playback, may appear
when playing FLAC files. This is a known bug in VLC versions 3.0.18 and
earlier. The solution is to upgrade, but 3.0.18 seems to be the latest version
available in some (most?) repositories. This isn't a fault in `vlc-server`,
and can't be fixed there.
