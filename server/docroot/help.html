vlc-server audio server, version %%VERSION%%
</p>

<h3 id="playing_local_audio_tracks">Playing local audio tracks</h3>
<p>
The most rudimentary way to find audio to play is to browse 
local folders. You can do this
<a href="/gui/files?covers=1">with cover art</a> or 
<a href="/gui/files?covers=1">without cover art</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can also list tracks by album, or list all artists, album artists,
genres, or composers. Again, this can be with, or without, cover art.
Links for these features are on the <a href="/gui/home">home page</a>.
</p>
<p>
In general, a list of tracks will contain links to the album that contains
the track, the artist, the genre, and the composer. You can use these 
links to navigate the audio library.
</p>

<h3 id="playing_remote_urls">Playing remote URLs</h3>
<p>
The 'URL...' link in the menu bar pops up a dialog box, in which you
can enter a remote URL to, for example, an Internet radio station.
</p>

<h3 id="results_pages">Results pages</h3>
<p>
In general, the server will only show a limited number of results -- with
or without cover images -- on a particular page. The limit is set by
the server administrator, and defaults to thirty.
</p>
<p>
This limit is to protect the server and the browser from searches that
might return thousands of results. With a large audio library, that would
certainly be possible.
</p>
<p>
If the number of results is large than the limit, then navigation links
will be shown at the top of the page.
</p>

<h3 id="the_playlist">The playlist</h3>
<p>
Everything played by the audio player is in a <a
href="/gui/playlist">playlist</a> of some sort, even if it contains only one
item. Because the player can handle local and network audio streams, the
playlist displays URLs, not titles or albums. If the playlist entry begins with
the '@' sign, it is a local file, relative to the media root folder. If it
begins with '/', it is an absolute filename on the server.  Entries that begin
'http:', 'rtsp:', etc., are remote URLs.
</p>
<p>
In general, if you click a link labelled '[add]', that will add something
to the existing playlist. Anything labelled '[play]' will replace the 
playlist with different content.
</p>
<p>
</p>

<h3 id="cover_art">Cover art</h3>
<p>
Most methods for browsing content have an option to show, or not to show,
cover art. In general, cover art images are files with conventional
names like <code>folder.png</code> in the same folder as the corresponding
audio file. The library scanner will extract images from audio files
if it finds any, or you can just store image files in the appropriate
directories.
</p>
<p>
Display of cover art is optional because the images take a substantial
amount of screen space, and this may be unhelpful on a small display
(like a cellphone). Over a slow network connect, the images may also
take a while to transfer, which will make the display slow to update.
</p>

<h3 id="searching">Searching</h3>
<p>
There is a general search form on the <a href="/gui/home">home page</a>.
This will search for a specific keyword in all of the database fields
that the server supports. Only the first few matches of each type
are displayed: there will be a link to the full list if there are
more.
</p>
<p>
The text search matches whole words, so 'part' will match 'part one',
but it won't match 'parting'. If you need more flexibility than this,
you can use a customer SQL query on the database.
</p>

<h3 id="custom_sql_queries">Custom SQL queries</h3>
<p>
You can search for tracks using SQL queries, if the built-in search 
facilities don't suffice. This isn't the place to describe SLQ (it is
well-documented), but here are some examples. 
</p>
<p>
Search for tracks in albums whose names contain 'Bach' (case-insensitive):
<pre>
album like '%bach%'
</pre>
<p>
Search for tracks in albums whose 'year' tag is exactly '2020':
<pre>
year='2020'
</pre>
</p>
<p>
Search for tracks whose album artist tag begins with 'various':
<pre>
album_artist like 'various%'
</pre>
</p>

<p>
The following fields can be searched:
<code>path</code> (text), 
<code>size</code> (number), 
<code>mtime</code> (number), 
<code>title</code> (text), 
<code>album</code> (text), 
<code>genre</code> (text), 
<code>composer</code> (text), 
<code>artist</code> (text), 
<code>album_artist</code> (text), 
<code>track</code> (text), 
<code>comment</code> (text), 
<code>year</code> (text). 
</p>

<p>
Most of these should be self-explanatory, but some require explanation.
</p>

<p>
The <code>path</code> field is the filename of the track on disk,
relative to the media root folder. Depending on how media files are
organized on disk, this field may contain directory names.
</p>

<p>
<code>size</code> is simply the size of the file, in bytes.
</p>

<p>
<code>mtime</code> is the modification time of the file on disk, and can
be used to search for files that have recently been added to the collection.
The format of this field, however, is a Unix epoch timestamp, which is
rather unwieldy. To make it easier to search for files of a particular
age, there is a custom SQL function <code>daysold</code>. To find 
tracks that were updated less than a week ago, for example: 
<pre>
daysold(mtime) < 7
</pre>
</p>

<p>
Bear in mind that when SQL <code>like</code> expressions contain
wildcards (%), these will match any number of any character. For 
convenience, vlc-server's SQL support has a non-standard test
<code>regexp</code> that will perform a regular expression test.
This can be useful when a crude wildcard like % will match things
that are unhelpful. For example, this expression: 
<pre>
artist regexp \bAC\b''
</pre>
will match 'AC/DC', but it won't match "Flac". Regular expression
tests are case-insensitive.
