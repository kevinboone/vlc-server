Everything is to do:

- Display genres, artists, etc
- Provide a search facility
- Read key bindings from a file
- Colour display, if the hardware supports it

Ideally, all of this needs to be done using no navigation other
than cursor keys, so that the interface works with an IR remote
control or front-panel navigation pad.
