Multi-byte characters do not display properly on the Pi, when using the kernel
console as the display device. Not only do they display badly, but ncurses
functions that are supposed to truncate output to a specific number of columns
don't work properly, so text overflows and generally messes up the display. The
same mode of operation works fine on Fedora, so I suspect that there's a
problem with the Pi version of ncurses. There needs to be at least a workaround
for this, wherever the fault is.
