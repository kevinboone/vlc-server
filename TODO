Everything is still to do :)

Obviously, indexing by metadata needs to be implemented, along with the
additional capabilities in the web UI

Seek within file/stream

Split path components in files/directories display, to make navigation easier.

Put an "up" link in the files/directories display
 
Radio stream list (how do we maintain this?)

Search in files/folders (but perhaps this can be deferred until indexing
is implemented -- an exhaustive filesystem search in response to an
HTTP request is a little dodgy)

Read RC file at server start (rather than needing to specify a long command line).
 
"vlc-server-client stat" shows real media file location, because the "stat"
API call does. We should really substitute "@" for the media root if the
file is relative to the media root. However, this leads to a broker
URL -- file:///@/something. This won't easily parse in the JavaScript
method response_callback_refresh_status, so no URL will be displayed.

The Web interface doesn't show the file part of the media URL in the interface
at all, if it contains an "#" character. This is an oddity of the rather
ugly parse_uri() function.
