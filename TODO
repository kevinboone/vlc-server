The main server is generally functional. It provides a graphic web
interface and a REST API for other clients. The API exposes much of
the functionality that a client might need, but my no means all. The
API calls are rather fine-grained, so a client might need to make
many calls to accomplish a simple action.

The real deficiencies are in the clients. At present, there are two:
a command-line client, and a curses-based console client.  Both are
very crude, and offer limited functionality.  The console client is,
at least, useable, if a media collection is organized by album. But
it really needs a lot of work, to be genuinely useful. It's difficult
because the client is designed to be run on a Linux console using a
four-way navigation pad, not a screen and keyboard. 

Please see the TODO files in the specific sub-modules for details.
