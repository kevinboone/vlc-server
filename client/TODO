Combine list-dirs and list-files into one command, and show both files and
directories.

"vlc-server-client stat" shows real media file location, because the "stat"
API call does. We should really substitute "@" for the media root if the
file is relative to the media root. However, this leads to a broker
URL -- file:///@/something. This won't easily parse in the JavaScript
method response_callback_refresh_status, so no URL will be displayed.
