This command-line client is very crude and inconsistent. For example,
there is a 'list-albums' command, but no way to play a specific
album. Moreover, there is no way to impose search constraints so you
can't, for example, show albums by a specific artist.  Really, the
utility is only workable for handling specific files, not metadata. 

Combine list-dirs and list-files into one command, and show both
files and directories.

"vlc-server-client stat" shows real media file location, because the
"stat" API call does. We should really substitute "@" for the media
root if the file is relative to the media root. However, this leads
to a broker URL -- file:///@/something. This won't easily parse in
the JavaScript method response_callback_refresh_status, so no URL
will be displayed.
